     "For example : if the secret word is GATE,and the first guessed word is SOIL would result in- 0 BULLS & 0 COWS (since all the guessed letters are not in the secret word). If the guessed word is TRIM it would result in - 0 BULLS & 1 COWS ( since T is present, but not in the exact position), and if the guessed word is RAGE it would result in - 2 BULLS & 1 COWS (since A and E are in the right position while G is in the wrong position).The game would continue until you guess the right word with - 4 BULLS "
